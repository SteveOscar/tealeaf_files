# Seeing a '!' on the end of a method often means that the method mutates the caller. 
# A '?' can mean that the method returns a boolean value. But these symbols when used 
# as part of method names are not syntax.

#    != means does not equal, and I have used it in conditional statements for comaprisons
#    !! returns the boolean value of the obect prepended (! gives the opposite value)
